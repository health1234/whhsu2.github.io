We found and synergized two data sources.

[Google Health Search Interest Data: ](https://www.kaggle.com/GoogleNewsLab/health-searches-us-county/home)
The data consist of regional interest by condition over time. There is information on metropolitan areas in 46 States, 9 Search topics: cancer, cardiovascular, stroke, depression, rehab, vaccine, diarrhea, obesity, diabetes, and 14 years (2004-2017).

[CDC Selected Metropolitan Area Risk Trends (SMART) Data ](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Behavioral-Risk-Factors/Behavioral-Risk-Factor-Surveillance-System-BRFSS-P/dttw-5yxu)
The source has information on disease prevalence in the U.S. from 2011 to present.
We tidy data from this source to get prevalence by year, state, and disease and apply them into the association analysis with search data from the former source.
