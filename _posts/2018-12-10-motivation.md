What would you do when youâ€™ve been having this weird headache intermittently for a week? Would you directly go to a doctor? Guess the answer is the same for most of us: we google it first!

This brings us to wonder what google health search trends are telling us. Are people generally becoming more aware of health conditions and health risks? How does search interest for top health issues change over time? Are there huge differences in heath concerns between states?

We believe google searches offer much more information than symptom description or  illness diagnose. Thus, we decided to take a further look into the search numbers.
