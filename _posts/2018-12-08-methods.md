1.	Tidy the data from wide version into long version.
2.	Draw line charts to present all disease searches by state and year.
3.	Draw distribution maps for each disease to see the differences in search preference between states. (The search data reflects the relative search interest for people in a certain area.)
4.	Present distribution maps for the actual disease prevalences across the country. Compare prevalence with the search interest to see if the states who care more about health are also healthier.
5.	Conduct regression analysis for each disease to see if more search is associated with higher or lower prevalence, and if the association differ between diseases?

6.	Most importantly, analyze the feasibility to conduct inference and suggestions for public healthcare provider, policy maker, and friends moving to the U.S. (e.g. vaccine amount prediction, public education on reducing obesity.)
