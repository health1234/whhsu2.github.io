Through this project, we want to answer the following questions:
1.  Are people more concerned about health now? Is the trend the same across states?

2.  Are people in different states concerned about different diseases?

3.  Is there an association between search interest and actual disease prevalence? 
- Can a yearâ€™s search interest predict a relevant health outcome in the following year? 
- Are states who care more about health actually healthier or more vulnerable?

4.  What can be inferred and what suggestions can be drawn for public healthcare provider, policy maker, and friends moving to the U.S.?
