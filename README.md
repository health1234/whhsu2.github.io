## Getting Started

HPSTR takes advantage of SCSS and data files to make customizing easier. This theme requires Jekyll 3.x and will not work with older versions properly.

To learn how to install and use this theme check out the [Setup Guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme/theme-setup/) for more information.
